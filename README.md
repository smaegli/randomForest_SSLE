# randomForest_SSLE

This repo includes my very amateur R scripts to build Random Forest classification models for the automatic recognition of small-scale landscape elements (SSLE).
Two models are created: NonVeg (for non-vegetational SSLE) and Veg (vegetational). Scripts are separated into data preparation (prep) and model creation (RFmodel) for better readability.
